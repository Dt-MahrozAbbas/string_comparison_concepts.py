# ðŸ§  Python String Behavior Guide

A hands-on educational repository that explores **Python string comparisons**, sorting, and behavior of assignments inside loops. Perfect for learners and interview prep!

---

## ðŸ“‚ File Included

- `string_comparison_concepts.py`  
  Core script with detailed examples and comments.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

### 1. `max(list_of_strings)`
- Shows how Python returns the **lexicographically maximum** string.
- Example:
  ```python
  max(["flower", "flow", "flight"])  # returns "flower"
````

### 2. `max(list, key=len)`

* Returns the **longest string** by length.

### 3. `sorted()` vs `.sort()`

* `sorted()` returns a **new sorted list**.
* `.sort()` **modifies the list in-place** and returns `None`.

### 4. Assignment Inside Loops

* Demonstrates how `i = i + 100` inside a `for i in range(...)` has **no effect** on the loop variable outside that iteration.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python string_comparison_concepts.py
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

* Understand the difference between lexicographic and length-based comparisons.
* Distinguish between `sorted()` and `.sort()`.
* Learn how loop variables behave when reassigned inside loops.

---

## ðŸ“š Ideal For

* Python beginners
* CS students
* Technical interview prep
* Developers revising Python fundamentals
